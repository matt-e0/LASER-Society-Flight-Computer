# LASER-Society-Flight-Computer
This is a work in progress rocket flight computer for the LASER society at the University of Liverpool.
I have only done the hardware design so far, I plan to program the microcontroller myself to showcase its functionality or I can burn the Arduino bootloader to the board.
